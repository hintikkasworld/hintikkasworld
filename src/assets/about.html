<h1>Hintikka's world - Help</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

Hintikka's world is a tool to show intelligent artificial agents with higher-order knowledge (a knows that b knows that...).
It enables to explore mental states of the agents by clicking on agents.
It provides several examples. All examples
are modeled in Dynamic epistemic logic. 



<h2>Help</h2>
The syntax for formulas is:
</br>
<code>phi ::= p | (not phi) | (phi or phi) | (phi and phi) | (phi implies phi) | (K a phi) | (Kpos a phi)</code>
</br>

<h3>Developpers</h3>
The tool was originally developped by François Schwarzentruber (ENS Rennes, France) in Javascript. The tool was presented as a demonstration at ECAI-IJCAI 2018. 
In 2019, Arthur Queffelec (University of Rennes 1, France) suggested to rewrite the application
in Typescript and using the framework Angular, in order to ease other contributors to participate to the project. In 2019, still, just after, Tristan Charrier (University of Rennes 1, France), Sébastien Gamblin (university of Caen, France) and Alexandre Niveau (university of Caen, France).
Sébastien Gamblin and Alexandre Niveau worked on symbolic models; in particular they implemented a web version of CUDD, a library for manipulating BDD (binary decision diagrams).
Their work is compiled in Web Assembly. 
Pham Hai Trung worked on simplifying the design of the software. Recently, we started a collaboration with Frederic Maris (university of Toulouse 3) to implement symbolic models with the tool Touist. Pâris Douady improved Touist, implemented a webservice for Touist and improved the organisation of Hintikka's World.
